# Cat & Dog Classification Project

This project contains a CNN model built with Keras and TensorFlow to classify images of cats and dogs.

## Setup

To run this project, the following libraries must be installed:
- TensorFlow
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset

This project uses the "Dogs vs. Cats" dataset from Kaggle. To run the model, you need to download and prepare the data:

1.  Download the dataset from this address: [https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dogs-vs-cats/data)
2.  In the main project folder, create a new folder named `data`.
3.  Unzip the downloaded `train.zip` file and copy the `train` folder inside it into the `data` folder you just created.

The final folder structure should be as follows:
`YourFolder/data/train/`

## Usage

After the dataset is prepared, you can run the `catsdogs.py` script to train the model and see the results.
